Tic-tac-toe

Authors: Jon Durden and David Sawyer


This program is a Tic-tac-toe game. There are four different types of players: a human (that's you!),
a naive computer, a random computer, and a cutthroat computer. In order to run the program, you must
first compile it. While in the directory containing the program files, type

javac TicTacToe.java

Now to run the program, you must include 2 command line parameters, they may be any permutation of
these four words: human, naive, random, or cutthroat. To run the program, type

java TicTacToe <X player> <O player>

The first command line parameter will always be the X's in the game and will always go first. Feel
free to pit the computer players against one another to see how they do, or you may also do a human
versus human game. For further assistance on how to run Tic-tac-toe, refer to the makefile.
